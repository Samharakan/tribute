                <ul>
                    <li><b>1791:</b> Charles Babbage is born in England on December 26th</li>
                    <li><b>1798:</b> Sent to Alphington near the city of Exeter for schooling and to recover from a fever that was nearly fatal</li>
                    <li><b>1810:</b> The already self-taught mathematician attends Cambridge. Due to his extensive background in math, he was disappointed by the instruction available at the university</li>
                    <li><b>1812:</b> Babbage, along with John Hershel and George Peacock, form the Analytical Society, a group that promoted the Leibnizian notation for differentiation in calculus</li>
                    <li><b>1814:</b> The scholar graduates without honors for defending a thesis that was considered blasphemous at the time</li>
                    <li><b>1815:</b> Babbage lectures at the Royal Institution on astronomy</li>
                    <li><b>1816:</b> Made a fellow of the Royal Society</li>
                    <li><b>1822:</b> Work begins on the Difference Engine, a mechanized machine capable of solving polynomial functions. It used four basic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division</li>
                    <li><b>1825:</b> Babbage works with John Hershel to publish Aragoâ€™s rotations</li>
                    <li><b>1831:</b> The difference engine is left unfinished due to funding problems. While it was never completed by Babbage, two fully functional models were constructed in 2002 </li>
                    <li><b>1838:</b> Babbage invents the pilot, the metal device on the front of trains that is meant to clear the track of obstacles </li>
                    <li><b>1840-1871:</b> Babbage invents the Analytical Engine. It marked the transition from mechanical arithmetic to full-blown computation. It had memory, a processor, and it could be programmed with small punch cards. Like the Difference Engine, this machine was never built. However, the Analytical Engine is considered to be the first conception of the modern computer</li>
                    <li><b>1871:</b> Charles Babbage dies in his home at the age of 79</li>
